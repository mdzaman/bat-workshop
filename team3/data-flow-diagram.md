1. **External Clients**
   - Developers and businesses accessing the platform
   - Web portal and API client interactions

2. **API Gateway**
   - Handles authentication
   - Implements rate limiting
   - Manages request routing

3. **Microservices Cluster**
   - Includes specialized services:
     - User Service
     - SMS Routing
     - Billing Service
     - Reporting

4. **SMS Carriers**
   - Global telecom providers
   - Message delivery network

5. **Database & Storage Layer**
   - Utilizing PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka
   - Supports data persistence and processing

The diagram shows the flow of data through the system:
- Clients interact with the API Gateway
- Requests are routed through microservices
- Messages are sent to carrier networks
- Data is stored and processed in the database layer

The color-coded components and connecting arrows illustrate the complex interactions within the platform.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the data flow in more detail?
