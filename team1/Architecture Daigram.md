Below is a description of the architecture for the **Farmer Onboarding and Marketplace Setup Module** and the corresponding architecture diagram in text format.  

---

### Architecture Overview  
The architecture integrates the user-facing components, backend services, and third-party integrations to ensure a seamless experience for farmers registering and listing products.  

---

### Components  
1. **Frontend (Mobile App & Web)**  
   - Farmer-facing mobile-first UI (Bangla and English)  
   - Features: Registration form, crop listing, profile management, and geolocation tagging  

2. **Backend Services**  
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles farmer verification (via national ID or cooperative membership)  
   - **Farmer Profile Service**: Stores and manages farmer data (landholding, crop details)  
   - **Product Listing Service**: Manages crop listings, inventory, and geolocation data  
   - **Pricing Recommendation Service**: Provides price suggestions based on market trends  
   - **Notification Service**: Sends alerts for inventory updates, expiring listings, etc.  

3. **Third-party Integrations**  
   - **Government Database API**: Verifies farmer identity and landholding information  
   - **Market Data API**: Fetches live and historical price trends for crops  
   - **Geolocation API**: Tags farmer location to product listings  

4. **Data Storage**  
   - **Relational Database**: Stores farmer profiles, crop listings, and transaction history  
   - **NoSQL Database**: Manages real-time inventory data and notifications  
   - **File Storage**: Stores uploaded documents and images of crops  

5. **Offline Mode**  
   - Local SQLite database on the device for offline data storage  
   - Synchronization service to push offline data to the backend when connectivity is restored  

6. **Security & Compliance**  
   - **Encryption**: Secure data during transmission (e.g., HTTPS, TLS)  
   - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restricts access to sensitive data

### Key Features in the Diagram  
- **Frontend Layer**: The mobile app and web portal are the main interfaces for farmers and admin users.  
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a centralized entry point for managing all API requests.  
- **Microservices**: Each core feature (authentication, profile management, product listing) is handled by a dedicated service.  
- **Data Storage**: Organized into relational and NoSQL databases for flexibility and performance.
